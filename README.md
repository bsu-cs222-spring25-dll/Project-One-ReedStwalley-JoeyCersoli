This project focuses on pulling data from Wikipedia. The main method calls an instance of the getInput method in the Menu class, which asks the user to enter a search request. The user's input is then ran through the errorHandler class to make sure it contains no errors. If it doesn't then the input goes through the wiki class in order to grab the data from Wikipedia, and then the sorted list is printed out.
